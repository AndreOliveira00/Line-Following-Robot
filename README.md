The project in question seeks to develop an implementation of a dynamic and properly autonomous system that promotes the movement of a vehicle with differential wheels according to computational processes allocated to several ROS nodes. The Raspberry Pi 3 on board the vehicle is equipped with a raspicam capable of extracting the various information from the route. The processing of these images must result in a precise actuation in the motors coupled to each wheel.
